This is a test vault showcasing different aspects of SQLSeal. It is made to resemble personal vault you might end up having with bunch of daily notes, tags and CSV files. All data here are fictional for demo purposes only.

## Project Structure
The project consists of
- Daily Notes (in /Daily folder) - some of them aggregate daily tracking data.
- Weekly notes aggregating daily notes data.
- List of friends (in /Friends folder)
- Daily tracking of transport and finances details in CSV files (in /Data folder)
- Movies watchlist imported from IMDB (in /Movies folder)
- Dashboards - aggregation of some of these data.


I recommend to start with the [[Basics]] file first and then explore vault on your own.
